## Security Advocate: What Makes We The North Stand Out

From a security analyst’s point of view, **we the north darknet market** sets itself apart by focusing on both operational security and user protection. The platform launched in 2021 after the closure of the Canadian Headquarters DWM, providing a new home for vendors and buyers seeking a safer, locally-focused alternative. With over 9,000 active listings as of 2025, it remains robust despite law enforcement crackdowns. Key security features include:

- **Escrow-protected payments** to minimize fraud risk.
- **Prohibition of dangerous categories** (weapons, terrorism, doxxing).
- **Internal messaging only:** No Telegram or offsite contacts—everything happens onsite.
- **Mirrored access domains:** So users aren’t left out by DDoS or takedowns.
